            <div class="content">
                <p>The website of the portfolio is mainly presented in the way of brief introduction, and the color
                    chosen is mainly on a black background, which makes the overall style slightly mysterious and calm.
                    Add a little pink and yellow to make the site a little more soft and lively.</p>
                <p>LOGO design name for the butterfly girl, because I want to be as free as a butterfly, so in addition
                    to the wings also added a woman's profile. Natural without losing the theme. The choice of color
                    also fits the style of the website and uses darker red and green. Calm colors can make people more
                    sensible when making decisions. This is also hoped that you will be cautious when choosing me.</p>
                <p>Besides, in this gorgeous age, I think simple things are often more direct and clear. You can see my
                    works and style at a glance from my website, which makes this serious society more kindly.</p>
